The title of this would be in small caps if github let me. Q_Q

This is a keyboard layout bundle collection I created. I wrote the OS X ones, and Conor O'Brien wrote the windows small caps.


On OS X, put the 3 bundles (normally looks like a lego AFAIK) in `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`.

On Windows, [read these instructions](https://github.com/RikerW/Keyboard-Layouts/blob/master/Windows/Smallcaps/README.md).
